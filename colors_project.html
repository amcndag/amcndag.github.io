        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I developed a full web page where a user can log in and search for colors under their account and add new colors that they do not have. <br>
            It utilized the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack. I created a database for the users and colors using MySQL. The API endpoints were provided <br>
            but tested using Postman. The front end utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The final product was tested to make sure it could handle valid and invalid log ins, <br>
            log out, searching for colors, and adding colors to the user's database.

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
            The first thing I learned from this project was how to deploy a Droplet, using Digital Ocean. I also bought my first domain for this project. <br>
            I learned how to manage the DNS and point the IP address to the applet. Secondly, I learned the building of databases in MySQL. <br>
            Moreover, I discovered how to test API endpoints using Postman. I checked the Login, AddColors, and SearchColors endpoints to see if they had any errors. <br>
            Additionally, it increased my knowledge and experience of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I was part of a three person group tasked with creating the core part of a MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) <br>
            processor simulator, called MySPIM. It was written in the C programming language and ran on a Unix platform. It simulated the functions of the MIPS processor, <br>
            such as the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), the fetching, partitioning, and decoding of instructions, reading and writing to memory, and many more. <br>
            Besides building my parts of the simulator, I also tested the project against the provided inputs and reported any problems that arose while testing <br>
            back to my teammates, and fixed any issues from my portion of the code.

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
            One of the biggest things I learned from this project was team-work and leadership skills. This was my first group project in any technical class.<br>
            I learned how to schedule and streamline the coding of the simulator between three individuals. <br>
            I made sure everyone was up to date on what needed to be completed by the agreed upon timeline. <br>
            Additionally, it strenghtened my proficiency of the C language and helped to better understand MIPS, which we learned about in class. <br>
